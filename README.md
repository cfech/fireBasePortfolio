# React-Portfolio
My portfolio completely re-made with react.js. It is made primarily with components and props to pass information from a hand built json file. It is fully responsive and has all of my contact information, resume as well as individual and group projects. It is being hosted on firebase and can be accessed at www.connorfech.com
